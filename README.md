# Flappy Bird
A very simple flappy bird style game using the pygame library in python.

## Controls
Press the spacebar to start the game and press up arrow key to control the bird.

## Note
The code is pretty messy and the game is still being developed :)  
Also Pygame needs to be installed `pip install pygame`
